# Meditation Session - January 28, 2026

**Session Type**: Knowledge Consolidation
**Duration**: Standard meditation
**Trigger**: User-requested ("let's meditate")

## Session Context

**Project**: markdown-to-pdf
**Primary Activity**: SVG banner creation and documentation polish

## Insights Consolidated

### 1. SVG Animation Expertise (NEW DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE)

Created comprehensive domain knowledge file capturing practical patterns learned through iterative banner development:

- **Artifact-free animations**: Initial opacity states, z-order control
- **Gradient compatibility**: Solid colors safer than `url(#gradient)` strokes
- **Animation architecture**: Background loops, foreground plays once
- **Ambient effects**: Radial gradients with blur filters for glow orbs

### 2. Iterative Design Process

Reinforced bootstrap learning principles:
- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- User feedback drives refinement
- "Polish" means simplification as often as addition
- Visual debugging requires systematic approach

### 3. Documentation Excellence

Applied to README and sample.md:
- Hero sections with centered HTML and navigation
- Feature tables with icons for scannability
- Sample files should demonstrate ALL features comprehensively

## Memory Files Modified

| File | Action | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `DK-SVG-ANIMATION-PATTERNS.md` | Created | New domain knowledge for SVG animations |
| `copilot-instructions.md` | Updated | Added synapse trigger and domain knowledge reference |

## Synapses Established

| Target | Strength | Type | Direction |
| ------ | -------- | ---- | --------- |
| DK-ADVANCED-DIAGRAMMING.md | High | Extends | Bidirectional |
| bootstrap-learning.instructions.md | Medium | Demonstrates | Forward |

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Memory file created: `DK-SVG-ANIMATION-PATTERNS.md`
- [x] Synapse added to `copilot-instructions.md`
- [x] Session documented in episodic memory

## Post-Meditation State

**Working Memory**: Clear - insights transferred to long-term storage
**Domain Slots (P5-P7)**: Available for new assignments
**Cognitive Readiness**: Optimized for continued engagement
